This is a README file for pcf -- a tool for remote computer identification. The
identification is done according to skew of the clocks inside each computer.
Clock skew of a specific computer is computed from TCP timestamps, ICMP
timestamps, and timestamps sent by JavaScript program available in the
timestamp46.html file. The program runs in an infinite loop and its output is an
XML file containing recognized computers. The program was developed and tested
in GNU/Linux.

For install and uninstall instructions see INSTALL file.

Usage
-----

Program has to be run as root or it has to have capabilities to listen for data
on network interfaces.

Usage: pcf [Options] [Interface]

  -h    Help
  -n    Number of packets to capture (0 -- default means infinity)
  -t    Number of seconds to capture (0 -- default means infinity)
  -p    Port number (1-65535, 0 -- default means all)
  -i    Disable ICMP
  -v    Verbose mode
  -e    Exports detected addresses with similar clock skew to stdout

Examples:
  pcf
  pcf -n 100 -t 600 -p 80 wlan0

The first example runs the program according to parameters listed in the config
file.

It is possible to stop the program by sending SIGINT or SIGTERM.

You can find more instructions about program configuration in the config file.
All options are explained in the config file.

You can configure your web server and enable web interface. You can see
recognized computers and manage them in your browser.

Program description
-------------------

The program pcf receives packets from libpcap interface. It searches for TCP
timestamps (see RFC 1323) and timestamps in TCP packets (e.g. those generated
by the JavaScript available in the timestamp46.html file in this repository).

Unless disabled by "-i" attribute, for each IP address that is detected to be
sending TCP timestamps, ICMP timestamp requests are sent and the replies are
processed by pcf.

The program processes all three kinds of timestamps separately. It is not
necessary that one IP address supports all kinds of timestamps.

Detected timestamp information are stored in the log/ directory. Program
log_reader may re-create graphs from these files.

Note
----

The active and saved computers are implicitly stored in the files active.xml and
database.xml located in www/data/ (TCP timestamps), www/data/javascript/
(JavaScript timestamps), and www/data/icmp/ (ICMP timestamps). Please follow
install instructions for more informations how to setup permissions for those
files.

The variable BLOCK in config file sets a limit after which the pcf re-computes
clock skews, generates graphs etc.

The program does not process packets with lower or the same timestamp as was
already seen for an earlier packet. This reduces the amount of data stored for
each computer but if a computer is restarted than pcf is not able to detect this
and cope with the situation because the timestamps are usually lower.

A correction is applied to computed frequencies:
freq >= 970 && freq <= 1030 => freq = 1000
freq >= 230 && freq <=  270 => freq = 250
freq >=  95 && freq <=  105 => freq = 100
In many cases this means that the frequency is fixed but sometimes it may result
in selection of wrong frequency because some systems may use unusual frequency.

Project history
---------------

The very first revision in the pcf repository (https://github.com/polcak/pcf) is
the result of the diploma thesis of Jakub Jirasek, which was successfuly
finished at Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology.
The original version supported only TCP timestamps and IPv4. You can see the
report on http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/study/DP/DP.php.en?id=14040&y=2011 (the text
is in Czech).

Later, the program was re-written in C++0x and support for IPv6 was added.
Moreover, support for simple detection of clockskew was added.

In addition, Barbora Franková extended pcf in her Bachelor Thesis and added
support for ICMP timestamps and JavaScript generated timestamps. See
https://github.com/bfrankova/pcf, commits dd287f and 9f1c92, and
http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/study/DP/BP.php.en?id=14704&y=2012 (in Czech).
